# PomodorApp (frontend)

PomodorApp is a single page productivity app written in vanilla JS to allow for users to track and complete items on their to-do list utilizing the Pomodoro method.
The Pomodoro method is a study technique where you study for 25 minutes, then take a break for 5 minutes, and repeat.

It is built with a Vanilla JS/HTML frontend, a Rails backend, and is styled with Bulma.

# Features

- Displays a random advice quote from the AdviceSlip api
- Plays music from an embedded Spotify playlist
- Users can start/stop a study session to track how long they studied and what tasks they accomplished during the session

# Usage
- Run 'rails s' in the backend directory to start the backend server - it will start on http://localhost:3000
- Open the index.html file in the frontend repo to use the app
- Register or log in using your name (no password) to access the app!
